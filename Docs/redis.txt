install:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server

sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf

change :

supervised no 

to:

supervised systemd

try:

sudo systemctl restart redis.service

if this error occur:
System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate. Failed to connect to bus: Host is down

run:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yqq daemonize dbus-user-session fontconfig

sudo daemonize /usr/bin/unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc /lib/systemd/systemd --system-unit=basic.target

exec sudo nsenter -t $(pidof systemd) -a su - $LOGNAME

then:
sudo systemctl status redis

As we enabled the Redis as a system daemon, it will automatically start with the system startup; 
if you want to stop that, run the following command and start it manually when you need.

sudo systemctl disable redis

then:

redis-cli
